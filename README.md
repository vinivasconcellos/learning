# learning
I started to learn more about programming language, such for front-end, back-end and data analysis.
So, it means HTML5, CSS, Java, Python. I decided to learn a bit of each one and then decide with each one I have more "connection".
Related to HTML, I did a CV Page (https://lnkd.in/eUytPHaq) using some contents (basics) of the learning process, like:
HMTL5:  Title: &lt;h1> Image insert: &lt;img alt="foto_perfil" src="foto_perfil.png"> Paragraph: &lt;p> Internal link: &lt;a href="Page to visit" target="_self" title="CV Digital">Go back&lt;/a> Ordered list: &lt;ol> Unordered list: &lt;ul>
CSS:  Color: style="color:;" Text orientation: style="text-align:;" Font size: style="font-size:20px"; Underline: &lt;u> Background color: background-color:FFD700; Strong: &lt;strong>
I did in mailchimp because was possible to publish it.
